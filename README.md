# Foody Call




Foody Call is an app that aims to connect people in order to sell or buy homemade food.
The app is trying to promote healthy eating and reduce food waste. Besides its possitive effect on health and environment,
Foody Call is a nonprofit that donates all its revenue to homeless shelters. 
We believe everyone has a right to have access to healthy food!
